# Prototypes  
These are some prototypes and previous iterations of the QDD design. The README.MD files in each version's subdirectory describe specific differences and design parameters.  

## V3: Working in progress (over winter break)  
Wallahi I am cooked for finals... Partial redesign - 11:1 gearbox, solid ring posts
**WIP**  


## V2: Integration Test, Pt 2 (12/6/2024 - 12/7/2024)
Slimmed-down package, functionally the same as V1. Printed with PLA/Unlubricated
### Fixes:
- Ngl I fixed pretty much nothing
### Issues:
- Gearbox binded up after running it really fast :skull:
- Cycloidal disk output holes get cut off by cam bearing
- Output shaft coupling assembly is overcomplicated
- Output shaft getting destroyed
- Screw heads stick out
- Low-quality cam bearings  

  
## V1: Integration Test (12/3/2024 - 12/5/2024)  
Integration test with BLDC motor (Mechanically feature complete). Printed with PLA/Unlubricated
### Fixes:
- Added spacer between cycloidal disks
- Retained camshaft
- Added thickness to output, now with 8mm M3 heat set inserts
- Added hex nut retainers to back of gearbox
- Did not fix anything but added pretty cutouts <3
### Issues:
- **Cycloidal disk output holes get cut off by cam bearing**
- Output shaft coupling assembly is overcomplicated
- Output shaft getting destroyed
- Screw heads stick out
- Low-quality cam bearings _(another one broke; perhaps should stop getting them from aliexpress)_  

  
## V0: Gearbox Only (12/1/2024 - 12/3/2024)  
Prototype gearbox design, driven by a drill. Printed with PLA/Unlubricated
### Issues:  
- ~~Insane friction between cycloidal disks~~
- ~~Middle camshaft not retained~~
- Output shaft coupling assembly is complicated since 6706-2RS Bearings were the biggest ones I had on hand
- Output shaft getting destroyed by cycloidal disks
- Cycloidal disk output holes get cut off by cam bearing
- ~~Output heat set insert only 3mm~~
- ~~Screw heads stick out and interfere with rotation (the whole thing is literally friction fit lol)~~
- Low-quality cam bearings. One blew up
